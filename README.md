##  1. Stop gninnipS My sdroW! ( 6 Kyu )

Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (like the name of this kata).

Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces.
Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

##  2. Bit Counting ( 6 Kyu )

Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.

## 3. Your order, please ( 6 Kyu )

Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.

Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.

## 4. Positions Average ( 6 Kyu )

Suppose you have 4 numbers: '0', '9', '6', '4' and 3 strings composed with them:

<p>s1 = "6900690040"</p>
<p>s2 = "4690606946"</p>
<p>s3 = "9990494604"</p>

Compare s1 and s2 to see how many positions they have in common: 0 at index 3, 6 at index 4, 4 at index 8 ie 3 common positions out of ten.

Compare s1 and s3 to see how many positions they have in common: 9 at index 1, 0 at index 3, 9 at index 5 ie 3 common positions out of ten.

Compare s2 and s3. We find 2 common positions out of ten.

So for the 3 strings we have 8 common positions out of 30 ie 0.2666... or 26.666...%

<p>Example:</p>
Given string s = "444996, 699990, 666690, 096904, 600644, 640646, 606469, 409694, 666094, 606490" composing a set of n = 10 substrings (hence 45 combinations), pos_average returns 29.2592592593.
